# Unix Commands in C
	I am going to be rewriting a bunch of C commands mostly taking them up in increasing order of difficulty. I am doing this as a part of learning C programming and Unix. Someday I will write a shell in C and use these as builtins in it.

# Commands Implemented
	[x] Echo
	[x] Head (I wont be doing tail since its pretty much the same. )
